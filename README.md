# SandBox JQuery CRUD App
#CRUD #javascript

### Ticket #HREXT05

This is a simple JQuery CRUD App I developed during my initial time as a student at Hack Reactor. The app implements the Get Things Done (GTD) philosophy of David Allen. 

Requirements: 
- [x] Create a basic CRUD framework for future development. 
- [x] Needs to be able to read and write to local storage in a generic fashion so that the development team can extend the functionality as needed.
- [x] Basic Form GUI with interactivity attached to the storage events.
